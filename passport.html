    <h3 class="pic" >What's about my game:</h3>
    <h4 class="pic">At first check out screenshots from my game:</h4>
    <div>

    <h3 class="aim">The point of my project is to make game , similar to space invaders.</h3>
    <h4 class="aim">When i got an aim to make pygame game with my knowledge,I remembered about space invaders.</h4>
    <h4 class="aim">Because in that game is contained : movement , level creation , and bullet collision</h4>
    <br>
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana,serif"> A bit about realization:</h2>
    <p class="realization">In my work , I have not used any uber rare special moves</p>
    <p class="realization">But some one can find interesting that I have own timer, ran by 'while' cycle</p>
    <p class="realization">And I find interesting my music volume fixer, which realization you can check in raw code</p>
    <p class="realization">As for me, I dont think I have any more secrets</p>
    <p class="realization">A bit about my code's environment:</p>
    <div>
        <ul class="realization">
            <p>Class Cannon is responsible for player's spaceship and it's movement</p>
            <p>Several classes Bullets are responsible for enemy's and players bullets</p>
            <p>Class Enemy responds for all enemies movement and lives including boss</p>
            <p>Functions as show_end,show_intro and show_defeat show menus when battle ends</p>
            <p>Additional classes and functions as load_level and Background help program work properly as I want</p>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="realization">But you can always write me in social media below, in case of any questions:</p>

    <h2>Last thing , technologies and requirements</h2>
    <p class="tech">As I said in README and presentation, I used only pygame , sys and random libraries , to make code readable and installable for all kind of programmers</p>
    <p class="tech">In addition to ordinary tools from pygame, I used mixer to play music</p>
    <p class="tech">All other libraries I used with their all known technologies</p>
